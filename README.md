# Data Engineering Course: Introduction to NoSQL

This repository contains the reading materials for an introductory course on NoSQL databases that forms part of the broader Data Engineer skills pathway. The content is organized into weekly modules that combine written lessons, diagrams, and practical guidance to help learners build a strong conceptual foundation before moving on to hands-on labs and projects hosted on the course platform.

## Repository Structure

- `Module-01/`: Course welcome materials and a deep dive into the NoSQL landscape. Later modules continue in a similar pattern (not included in this extract) and expand into specific technologies such as MongoDB, Apache Cassandra, and IBM Cloudant.
- `08-document-based-NoSQL-Database.md`: Supplemental reading that examines document databases in more detail, including terminology, storage patterns, and example queries.
- `data-engineer-skills-pathway.md`: Overview of the full learning path for aspiring data engineers.
- `settings.json`: Suggested editor configuration for working with the Markdown-based curriculum assets.

## Learning Roadmap

Each module pairs short readings with visuals, examples, and activities hosted on the learning platform. A typical progression is:

1. **Orientation** – Understand the course goals, expectations, and support resources.
2. **Foundations** – Explore NoSQL history, core concepts, and architectural characteristics.
3. **Technology Spotlights** – Study reference architectures and workflows for MongoDB and Apache Cassandra.
4. **Practice and Assessment** – Complete labs, knowledge checks, and a peer-reviewed project that reinforces the concepts.
5. **Optional Honors Content** – Extend your skills with cloud-hosted NoSQL services like IBM Cloudant.

## How to Use These Materials

- Start with the files in `Module-01/` to get oriented with the course and establish the terminology used throughout the modules.
- Continue with the numbered readings to build conceptual knowledge before attempting the hands-on labs referenced in the course shell.
- Use the supplemental documents when you need deeper explanations, visual aids, or quick refreshers on specific database models.
- Pair these readings with the synchronized Obsidian vault or other note-taking systems if you are using an MCP-assisted workflow; the Markdown format is designed to integrate cleanly with those tools.

## Prerequisites and Tooling

- Familiarity with relational database concepts and basic SQL will help you connect the NoSQL topics to prior experience, but the readings assume no prior NoSQL knowledge.
- A Markdown-friendly editor (VS Code, Obsidian, etc.) is recommended for navigating and annotating the material. The provided `settings.json` file includes linting and formatting preferences tailored to the course content.
